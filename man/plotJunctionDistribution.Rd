\title{Visualisation of the distributions of the statistics used within FraseR.}
\usage{
plotJunctionDistribution(fds, gr, type = gr$type, sampleIDs = NULL,
  rmZeroCts = FALSE, valueVsCounts = FALSE, qqplot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{fds}{A FraseR object}

\item{gr}{The range of interest to visualize.
Needs to match a junction or splice site within the FraseR obj.
Also it needs to have a type column specifying
the site of interest ("psi3", "psi5", "psiSite").}

\item{sample}{A vector of sampleIDs which should be highlighted.
If this value is not set but the gr object contains a sampleID
column it will take this column to highlight samples.}

\item{...}{Additional paramerters which are pased on to
the underlying plotting functions}
}
\description{
This can be used for quality control plots as well.
