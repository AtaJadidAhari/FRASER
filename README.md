# FraseR - Find RAre Splicing Events in RNA-seq
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/c-mertes/FraseR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/c-mertes/FraseR)

This is the preliminary repository for the R based splicing outlier detection package. **It's not yet production ready. So please be patient and stay tuned for updates.** 

The workflow aims to assist the diagnostics in the field of rare diseases where RNA-seq is performed to identify aberrant splicing defects.

This is the main repo of the R package FraseR. It's Bioconductor compliant and is planned to be submitted to Bioconductor.
